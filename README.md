### What I learned

Well, it was a smooth ride, it was fun recalling how to center a div again after a while off coding but i am happy to be fully back now. Google and youtube has always been very useful resources to me.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```HTML
  <section>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="image">
        <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr-code">
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <div class="main-text">
          Improve your front-end skills by building projects
        </div>
        <div class="sub-text">
          Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>
```

```css
section {
  height: 80vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
}

.container {
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  border-radius: 10px;
  max-width: 230px;
  margin: auto;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

### Continued development

Get more familiar with centering a div usinf flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://youtu.be/QdITQ4upjME) - This helped me for centering a div reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
